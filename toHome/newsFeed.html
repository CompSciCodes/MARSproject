		<h3 id="3">First 10,000 Days</h3>

		<p><b><u>The Work Begins:</u></b> The story begins in 2024 when Elon Musk and SpaceX launch 5 cargo ships to Mars. They land at Erebus Montes, paving the way for future humans to land, the construction of Mars Base Alpha, plants to grow, and later for a self sustainable Mars colony.</p>

		<p>This Mars colonization mini documentary also covers what it is like living on Mars, how many people will be landing during each launch window mission, the Starship fleet, and how the Martian colony grows over the years, between 2024 to 2050.</p>

		<p>Additional footage from: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona, European Space Agency, SpaceX, AI Space Factory, HASSEL, Tesla, The Boring Company</p>

		<p><b><u>Elon Musk's Plan to Colonize Mars:</u></b> <q>Earth-Mars synchronization happens roughly every two years. So every two years, there's an opportunnity to fly to Mars. So then in 2024, we want to try to fly four ships. Two of which would be crewed, and two which - two cargo and two crew. The goal of these initial missions is to find the best source of water, that's for the first mission. And then the second mission, the goal is to build the propellant plant.</q> <i><sub>~Elon Musk</sub></i></p>

		<p>The cruise phase begins after the spacecraft separates from the rocket, soon after launch. The spacecraft departs Earth at a speed of about 24,600 mph (about 39,600 kph). The trip to Mars will take about seven months and about 300 million miles (480 million kilometers). During that journey, engineers have several opportunities to adjust the spacecraft’s flight path, to make sure its speed and direction are best for arrival at Jezero Crater on Mars. The first tweak to the spacecraft’s flight path happens about 15 days after launch. For more information, visit <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/cruise/#:~:text=The%20trip%20to%20Mars%20will,at%20Jezero%20Crater%20on%20Mars." class="inlineLink" target="_blank">Mission to MARS</a>.</p>

		<p>Jezero Crater is 28 miles (45 kilometers) wide, and is located on the western edge of a flat plain called Isidis Planitia, which lies just north of the Martian equator. The landing site is about 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometers) from Curiosity's landing site in Gale Crater. For more information, visit <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/science/landing-site/#:~:text=Jezero%20Crater%20is%2028%20miles,landing%20site%20in%20Gale%20Crater." class="inlineLink" target="_blank">Mission to MARS</a>.</p>

		<p>Humanity has explored Mars since 1960, and we’ve never been closer. The next logical step for Mars exploration is permanent settlement, where crews that go to Mars stay and build a new society. Humans settling on Mars will inspire us all to make Earth a better place. Technology, scientific understanding, cooperation – is there anything we cannot achieve? The Mars One Foundation will help solve components of Mars permanence: crew selection and training, and technology for local resource use and to grow food. We are a global initiative focused on the greatest adventure of our time.  We are going to Mars.

		<p>NASA is working hard to develop the technologies astronauts will use to one day live and work on Mars, and return safely home. While there is much work ahead on the pioneering journey to Mars, one has to wonder: Where exactly will humans first land? This question was the basis for a recent workshop in which the agency collected 47 proposals for locations on the Red Planet that would provide natural resources to enable human explorers to land, live and work safely on Mars as well as provide a rich destination for scientific discovery.
